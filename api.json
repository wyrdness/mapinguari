      "full": "The Mapinguari is a legendary cryptid from the Brazilian Amazon, described as a large, sloth-like creature standing approximately 7 feet tall. Physical characteristics include red fur covering its body, a single eye (cyclops-like), a second mouth located in its belly, backward-facing feet, and a terrible odor. The creature is said to emit a paralyzing roar, attack humans and hunters, and be primarily nocturnal. Indigenous belief in the Mapinguari is widespread across Amazon indigenous groups. Some cryptozoologists theorize it could be a surviving giant ground sloth (Megatherium), while descriptions remain consistent across numerous tribes despite lack of physical evidence. The creature reportedly has bulletproof hide and massive sloth-like claws. Protection methods include climbing trees (which it supposedly cannot do) and making loud noises."
