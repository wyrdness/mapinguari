- Evidence primarily consists of consistent indigenous testimony
- Scientific interest based on:
  - Cultural consistency across separated groups
  - Plausible biological explanation (surviving ground sloth)
  - Amazon's capacity to hide undiscovered species

### Indigenous Knowledge Priority
Primary sources for Mapinguari are indigenous oral traditions. Any research should:
- Respect indigenous cultural authority
- Consult with communities before investigating
- Recognize traditional ecological knowledge
- Avoid exploitative or disrespectful approaches
